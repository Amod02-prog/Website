			<p align="center">Hello! My name is Amod N. Deshpande, I'm 20 years old and I'm working on a variety of skills ranging from pentesting to web develpment . I am a rookie in  coding Front-End and Back-End using different languages, such as HTML ,CSS. I gathered interest in Cybersecurity when I began high school. During my time in college, I was on the Computer Science track, which meant I was taking programming courses daily through the period I was enrolled. During the three years I learned Penetration Testing , Web Development , Web Exploitation and many other skill set  . I wasn't sure what I could do with a career with Computer Science at the time, but I knew I was excited to see something I created in real time. I was eager to learn new concepts and develop more dynamic projects with these new technologies. I was encouraged to seek out Hackathons by my friends and passed out alumnis, However I wasn't able to win any yet but I learnt a lot through these .Later! From there on, I knew I wanted to pursue Computer Programming professionally.
			<br><br>I'm currently attending SRM Institute of Science and Technology , obtaining a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering. Aftering graduation, I plan on working for a corporation and learn to stand on my feet by myself . I'm actively involved in a number of extracurricular activities, such as ACM W club, AARUUSH Finance, SRM Placement Cell as well  I'm looking to obtain a summer internship in Engineering in Summer 2023. Hopefully, in the next couple of years, I'll be in an Engineering or Security role where I'm passionate about my projects and using my platforn to inspire young minds to study STEM subjects.</p>
